# Intrinsic Bias Analysis in LLMs and Word2Vec

This project analyzes biases present in large language models such as BERT and Word2Vec. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **MLM Probing**: Intrinsic bias analysis is performed on masked language models (MLM), using the "NLP Fairness for India" dataset from Google, within an Indian social context.
2. **WEAT Analysis**: Bias is further analyzed using the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) on Googleâ€™s pre-trained Word2Vec model.

## Project Structure

- **`BIAS_NLP.ipynb`**: Contains all the executable code for the analyses.
- **`datasets/`**: Holds the dataset files used in the analyses.
- **`results/`**: Contains the output data collected from the analyses.
